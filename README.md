# README generator
## Overview

The README Generator can be used by developers to create a professional README.md file for their project. This is a CLI application built using node.js and the npm inquirer package. When the application is run from the command line, the user is prompted a few questions about the project. 
A professional README.md file is then generated using all the input gathered from the user.
